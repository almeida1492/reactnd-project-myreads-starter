# MyReads Project

MyReads is a React application that organize books in three shelves, which are "Currently Reading", "Want to Read" and "Read". The user can add new books to the shelves by clicking the "Add book" button, which will bring him/her to the search activity. In this activity, the user can type the names of the books (the search will look just for terms contained in the following list: https://github.com/almeida1492/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md) and add them to the shelves. Moreover, if the user clicks in a specific book, then the application will display relevant information about it, such as synopsis, publisher, publish date, rating etc.
